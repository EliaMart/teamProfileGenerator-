## Description 

Team profile generator is a node.js command-line application that will take in information about a team and generate an HTML webpage displaying the information. The information that needs to provide includes prompting the user to enter the managers name, ID email and office number. From there you will build your team of engineers or interns. If engineer is selected, you will need to provide their name, ID, email, and github. If intern is selected, you will need to provide their name, ID, email and school attended. From there, a webpage will be generated. 

To keep the code maintainable, test were created.
